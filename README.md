# The-Gaming-Room
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room requested the development of their take on the old 1980s guessing game, "Win, Lose, or Draw". They are doing with the name of their version as "Draw It or Lose It". Their initial request was to develope for Android but expreessed interest in looking at other operating systems as well.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I have a good voice in my responses to the client and present my findings in a professional manner while being informative.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It is nice to have a document to look at that shows all the core goals and values of a client to relate back to when developing the code for the program they requested.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve upon my recommendations after I have had a bit more experience with working with different operating systems in a coding sense.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is imporatnt to take all the clients input into consideration, as the onl cliche, the customer is always right. And it is good to make notes on teir requesrts and make your own reco9mmendations in the process that way if something they originally request they no longer like, you already have something to recommend to them that you know will work from experience. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I like to make an empathetic approach and try to really put myself in the customer's shoes. Do as much background research as I can so that what I develop is within the vision and ideals of the customer I am working for.
